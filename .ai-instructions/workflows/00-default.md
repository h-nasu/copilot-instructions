# Default Development Workflow

This workflow applies to all development tasks unless overridden.

---

## Workflow Steps

Unless overridden, this workflow applies.

1. Follow all before-task hooks
2. Implement changes incrementally
3. Run tests frequently
4. Refactor for clarity and maintainability
5. Follow all after-task hooks

Task-specific prompts may restrict execution
(e.g. plan-only, no implementation).

## Language-Specific Rules

Language- or framework-specific rules may be added here or overridden
by indexed workflow files.
